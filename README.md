## Project Title: Customer Engagement Analysis

**Description:**  My task was to build a three-page dashboard including key metrics and visualizations that aimed to show student engagement with the 365 platform and identify critical areas of improvement.

The following is a list of the questions we want our dashboard to answer:
1. Which courses are the most watched by students, and how are they rated?
2. How many students register each month, and what fraction are also onboarded?
3. How do students engage with the platform (minutes and average minutes watched) based on student type (free-plan or paying)?
4. Do students watch more content with time, and does it vary seasonally?
5. Which countries have the most students registered, and does this number scale proportionally with the number of minutes watched per country?
